###### Supported sources

* CloudWatch Logs
  * VPC Flow Logs

Coming soon:
* JSON CloudWatch Logs events
* sFlow v5

## Getting started

Cistern has no external dependencies.

```
Usage of ./cistern:
  -api-addr string
    	API listen address (default "localhost:2020")
  -config string
    	Path to config file (default "./cistern.json")
  -data-dir string
    	Data directory (default "./data/")
```



#### Config file

The config file has two main options:

* cloudwatch_logs: A list of CloudWatch Logs log groups to consume. See [VPC Flow Logs](#vpc-flow-logs) for more details.
* retention: The retention of events in days.

```json
{
  "cloudwatch_logs": [],
  "retention": 3
}
```

### VPC Flow Logs

You can specify the flow log groups to consume in the config file.
In the `cloudwatch_logs` section, add an object for each log group
with the name and `flowlog: true`.

**Example**

```json
{
  "cloudwatch_logs": [
    {
      "name": "flowlogs",
      "flowlog": true
    }
  ],
  "retention": 3
}
```

#### Credentials

Cistern will try to use AWS credentials from the following locations:

* The environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
* The Shared Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
* EC2 Instance Role Credentials

To specify the region, set the AWS_REGION environment variable.

## Querying

You can query Cistern using the API or the CLI, which uses the API.
Most of the logic is built into the API, so it's not a bad idea to
learn how the API works in order to make sense of the CLI.

### API

**POST /collections/:collection/compact**

This endpoint enforces the retention policy for the collection.

**POST /collections/:collection/query**

This endpoint queries events within a collection.

The query endpoint accepts a **Query** object, which has the following
syntax:

```js
Query: {
    /* All of the following are optional. */
    "time_range": TimeRange
    "columns":    []Column
    "group_by":   []string
    "filters":    []Filter
    "point_size": integer
    "order_by":   []string
    "limit":      integer
    "descending": bool
}

TimeRange : {
    "start": string
    "end":   string
}

Column: {
    "name":      string
    "aggregate": string
}

Filter: {
    "column":    string
    "condition": string
    "value":     *
}
```

#### Filters

Filters are applied as the first stage of query execution. A filter requires
a column name, a condition, and a value for the condition. The supported
conditions are:

* **eq**: equal
* **neq**: not equal

If multiple filters are specified, they are applied in an "AND" condition.

#### Generating time series

Time series can be generated by providing a nonzero `point_size`. This will
automatically group events by time ranges determined by the provided point size.

### CLI

```
Usage of ./cistern-cli:
  -address string
    	Cistern node address (default "http://localhost:2020")
  -collection string
    	Collection to query
  -columns string
    	Comma-separated list of columns to aggregate.
    	Example: 'sum(bytes), sum(packets)'
  -descending
    	Sort in descending order.
  -end int
    	End Unix timestamp
  -filters string
    	Comma-separated list of filters.
    	Filters have the format '<column> <condition> <value>'.
    	Possible conditions are [eq,neq].
    	Values have to be valid JSON values.
    	Example: 'dest_address neq "172.31.31.192" , packets eq 3'
  -group string
    	Comma-separated list of fields to group by.
    	Example: 'source_address, dest_address'
  -limit int
    	Maximum number of events to return.
  -order-by string
    	Comma-separated list of columns to order by.
    	Providing multiple columns means the results are ordered
    	by the first column, then the next, etc.
  -point-size duration
    	Point size of time series. 0 means series will not be generated.
  -start int
    	Start Unix timestamp
  -version
    	Show version and exit.
```

The CLI prints the output of the API response in JSON format.
